Tech/framework used:

 - Built in HTML 5 with CSS for styling only

Summary:

 - No functionality included, exercise was just in using styling and alignment to replicate the superficial look of the existing site
 - Short time limit so does not behave dynamically as the original site does
 - Does not have all the content of the original as time ran out
 - Some of the labels are missing as well as the footer
